## Objective
To develop and apply hands-on skills in wireless network security by conducting ethical attacks, analyzing network behavior, and implementing strategies to harden defenses.

### Skills Learned
- Wireless reconnaissance and environment setup using Kali Linux
- Packet capture and analysis (WPA2 handshake identification)
- Password cracking with wordlists  
- Execution of deauthentication attacks
- Monitoring real-world wireless traffic and diagnosing connectivity/authentication issues
- Applying legal and ethical standards in penetration testing

### Tools Used
- Kali Linux: Penetration testing tool to perform attacks on a vulnerable machine.

## Outcome
- Gained practical, real-world experience simulating wireless attacks and analyzing Wi-Fi traffic.
- Understood the limitations of legacy encryption (WPA2) and the benefits of modern protocols (WPA3).
- Demonstrated the ability to identify wireless vulnerabilities and recommend secure configurations.
- Prepared to assist organizations with Wi-Fi threat detection, incident response, and proactive security configurations in line with best practices.
